What is Geocoding?
Geocoding is term used to describe the act of address matching.  Geocoding
is the process of finding a geographic location (x, y point) for an address
(such as street number and name, city, state, and ZIP Code) on a map.
Geocoding is based off the typical address scheme for the US, in which one
side of the street contains even house numbers while the other side of the
street contains odd house numbers.

The geocoding process uses an algorithm to find the geographic location
of addresses. First, a street segment is identified using the zip code and
street name. Next, the geographic location of the address is matched using
the building number to determine how far down the street and on which side
of the street the building is located. Geocoding Accuracy

The locational accuracy of geocoded addresses may vary from urban to rural
areas due to the algorithm used to generate the geographic locations of
addresses. The algorithm assumes that the size of parcels are equivalent
along a road route. This assumption tends to be more consistent in urban
areas, where the size of parcels vary less than in rural areas.
Consequently, the results of geocoded addresses in urban areas are usually
more reliable than those in rural areas.

For example, the locational accuracy of rural addresses can be slightly
off because some parcels along a rural route may be 15 acres while others
may be 2.5 acres, but the geocoding algorithm assumes that the addresses
are distributed evenly along the route.<br /><br />

The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data
compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from
the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is
collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources)
who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in
FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the
data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees
about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check
with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist.

Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'.
The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no warranties, guaranties
or representations as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the data
provided by the data sources. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
makes no representations or warranties about the quality or suitability
of the materials, either expressly or implied, including but not limited
to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, or non-infringement. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center
shall not be liable for any damages suffered as a result of using,
modifying, contributing or distributing the materials.

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding
scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:

1) Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums
GeoPlan gathered information for zoos and aquariums listed at 
http://www.aza.org/findzooaquarium/ during the month of August. The appropriate 
information for each zoo or aquarium was extracted and placed in the proper format for 
geocoding. In total 15 unique records were extracted and all were able to be matched 
during the geocoding process.

2) GeoPlan gathered information for zoos and aquariums listed at 
http://www.officialusa.com/stateguides/zoos/florida.html during the month of August. 
Each website listed (if available) was visited and the appropriate information was 
extracted and placed in the proper format for geocoding. In total 30 unique records
were extracted and all were matched during the geocoding process.

-Sources for Arboretums &amp; Botanical Gardens:
1) Florida Association of Museums
GeoPlan gathered information for Arboretums &amp; Botanical Gardens listed at 
http://www.flamuseums.org/museums/ during the month of August. The categories
Arboretum and Botanical  Garden were searched. The appropriate information for each
facility was extracted and placed in the proper format for geocoding. In total 24 unique

of Library and Information Services' library database at http://www.fllibraries.org/. 
The database was downloaded in Excel format on August 11, 2011. The appropriate 
information was extracted and placed in the proper format for geocoding. There were 
1208 records in the original database and 1136 were able to be matched during the 
geocoding process.

-Sources for Motion Picture Theaters
1) Yellowbook.com
GeoPlan obtained information for motion picture theaters at  
http://www.yellowbook.com/yellowpages/?where=florida during August 2011. The 
term "Movie Theater" was searched for all locations in Florida. The appropriate 
information was extracted and placed in the proper format for geocoding. There were 
374 unique records extracted and 359 were able to be matched during the geocoding 
process.

-Sources for Museums and Art Galleries:
1) Art-Collecting.Com
GeoPlan gathered information for art galleries listed at 
http://art-collecting.com/galleries_fl.htm during the month of August. Each website 
listed (if available) was visited and the appropriate information was extracted and 
placed in the proper format for geocoding. In total 191 unique records
were extracted and all were matched during the geocoding process.

2) Florida Artists Registry.com
GeoPlan gathered information for art galleries listed at 
http://artistsregistry.com/catalog/galleries.php?a_sort=&amp;st=FL&amp;ct=USduring the month of 
August. The appropriate information was extracted and placed in the proper format for 
geocoding. In total 43 unique records were extracted and 41 were matched during the 
geocoding process.

3) Florida Association of Museums
GeoPlan gathered information for museums listed at http://www.flamuseums.org/museums/ 
during the month of August. Each museum type category was searched with the exception 
of Planetariums, Arboretums, and Botanical Gardens. The appropriate information for each 
museum was extracted and placed in the proper format for geocoding. In total 377 unique 
records were extracted and 373 were able to be matched during the geocoding process.

-Sources for Planetariums
1)Florida Association of Museums
GeoPlan gathered information for planetariums listed at 
http://www.flamuseums.org/museums/ during the month of August. The category 
Planetarium was searched. The appropriate information for each facility was extracted and 
placed in the proper format for geocoding. In total 8 unique records were extracted and all 
were able to be matched during the geocoding process

- Sources for Theaters and Performing Arts Centers
1)Florahome USA
GeoPlan gathered information for theaters and performing arts center listed at 
http://florahomeusa.blogspot.com/2011/03/theatres-and-performing-art-centers-in.html during 
the month of August 2011. The appropriate information for each theater and performing arts 
center was extracted and placed in the proper format for geocoding. In total 108 unique records
were extracted and all were able to be matched during the geocoding process.


All records were standardized, any remaining duplicates were removed and converted 
to a general database file (.dbf). The dbf was then geocoded against a statewide 2010 NAVTEQ 
street dataset and converted into a shapefile with the FGDL Albers HPGN map projection. 
(See "Map Projection Parameters" below). After geocoding the following steps were applied.

- Unmatched locations or locations receiving a score below 80 were 
  reevaluated using Google Maps. Locations' addresses that were 
  successfully located were modified to reflect the correct address using 
  the geocode rematch tool in ArcGIS. 
- 90 records were unable to be matched and removed from the database.
- Added and calculated the COUNTY, TYPE, OP_CLASS, USNG_FL_1K, LONG_DD, and, LAT_DD fields.
- Added the OPERATING, HOURS, YR_BUILT, COMMON_USE, USE, FLAG and UPDATE_DAY fields.
- Added FGDLAQDATE based on the date GeoPlan acquired the 
  data from the Source.
- Added the DESCRIPT field based on TYPE.
Process Date: 20110830
<br />
The GeoPlan Center performed the following steps in order to create the October 2015 
statewide culture center facilities data layer.

Locations were checked using imagery and Google Street View and either 
marked as Verified or Not Verified in the FLAG field, please see the FLAG field
Attribute Definition for more information.

Next GeoPlan Center performed the following attribute table adjustments:
